Download this directory structure and open 'ea.html', found in the 
public folder, as a local webpage to poll ebay to see if it has an item.
If the item is present, the screen will turn green and if you have placed 
a .ogg audio file called 'noise' into the 'public/sounds' folder
it will also be played when the item is found.

This will poll the UK ebay site every 10 minutes.
